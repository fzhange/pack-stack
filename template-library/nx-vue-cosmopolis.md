## use nx quickly

there is some basic knowledge about nx that can help you quickly use it. You can do some tests in this repo quickly.

### Create a new lib or components?

the plugin of NX has some powerful cli functionality that can help you do something quickly.

The functionality of cli is all from plugins. Let's have a look quickly.

First, run `nx list` command in your terminal.

Now Let's use it.

```bash
#1. create a lib named products
nx g @nx/vue:library products --directory=modules/products --unit-test-runner=vitest --bundler=vite

#2. create a component under products lib
nx g @nx/vue:component product-list --directory=modules/products/src/cart
```

Okay. Now we have created a products lib and a component.
The project name is defined at `modules/products/project.json`
the outputs are defined at `modules/products/vite.config.ts` called outDir field.

> [!TIP]
> The each of library that generated by cli
>
> - has a project details view where you can see the available tasks (e.g. running tests for just orders: nx test orders)
> - has its own project.json file where you can customize targets
> - has the name you specified in the generate command; you can find the name in the corresponding project.json file
> - has a dedicated index.ts file which is the "public API" of the library
> - is mapped in the tsconfig.base.json at the root of the workspace.

### How to see or run a task that you have?

First, the Nx provides a `show`` command that can help you to look at How many projects you have and the details of your project.

Let me show you quickly

So that you know that all projects and tasks are in our repo.
And the NX supports **cache and parallel** to run a task. It's a super powerful ability.

### Visualizing your Project Structure

Graph dependencies within the workspace

```bash
nx graph
```

> [!TIP]
> The arrows to orders and products are dashed because we're using lazy imports.
